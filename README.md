## Ways to run this app

### Run on repl.it
- I do have added the link of repl.it where you can directly run this without environment issues of node.
- create account on repl.it and open nodejs project to start with.
- Refer the index.js file and you're good to go.

### vs code
- you need to install nodejs from https://nodejs.org/en/download/ and get the latest stable version if you don't need to worry about the versions.
- open vscode and type the code of index.js file and open terminal to run it.
- run using command : 
        **npm filename.js**
- If not able to run then please install readlinesync package as 
        **npm install realine-sync** (which may solve problem).
